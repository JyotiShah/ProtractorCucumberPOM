# ProtractorCucumberPOM
These are my learning for Protractor with Cucumber and Typescript

How to use this framework?
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the code in editor of your choice (I prefer Visual Code Studio)
3. Open Terminal in IDE
4. Key command "npm install". All dependencies will be installed.
5. Key in your parameters for each env (under params)
6. To run tests, use npm test command.

Some features:
1. Allows you to set QA/DEV env in conf.ts
2. Protractor Logger is integrated
3. Cucumber reports are integrated
4. Have an expandable generic library
5. Provision to have separate data for different env
